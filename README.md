# Cancelled Mandates (CM)

## Input

Download Data as csv files:

1. CRM Data:              "crm-accounts-YYYY-MM-DD.csv"
2. Elevate Data           "elevate-accounts-YYYY-MM-DD.csv"
3. Failed Mandates        "failed-mandates-YYYY-MM-DD.csv"
4. Cancelled Mandates     "cancelled-mandates-YYYY-MM-DD.csv"

## Target

Get a CRM account number per failed or cancelled mandate.

## Methods to find a CRM account number

For each row in Failed and Cancelled Mandates "mandate_row", process sequence of methods until a CRM account number is found:

1. Check field "mandate_row"."customers.metadata.accountNumber", if it contains a valid CRM account number: 
   - yes: CRM account number is found, stop process.
   - no: continue with next check

2. Check field "mandate_row"."mandates.id", if we find a match in "elevate"."mandate_reference", if found, use the row's "elevate"."customer_account_number" to find its CRM account by matching "crm"."account_number".
   - yes: CRM account number is found, stop process.
   - no: continue with next check

3. Check field "mandate_row"."customers.id", if we find a match in "crm"."C0 Go Cardless Customer ID", the "crm" account number is found.
   - yes: CRM account number is found, stop process
   - no: continue with next check

4. Check concatenated field "mandate_row"."customers.given_name" & " " & "customer.family_name" against "crm"."C0 Name".
   - yes: CRM account is found, stop process
   - no: continue with next check

## Data to be enriched:

### Assign Team

Extract "crm"."stage name" (e.g. ACTIVE, SOLD, ...) and assign the corresponding team depending on stage name:

case "crm"."stage name":
  when: "SOLD"          : team = 'Pre Installation'
  when: "INSTALL"       : team = 'Pre Installation'
  when: "PROVISIONING"  : team = 'Post Installation'
  when: "INVOICING"     : team = 'Post Installation'
  when: "ACTIVE"        : team = 'Post Installation'
  when: "INACTIVE"      : team = 'No action - inactive'
  when others           : team = 'Pre Installation'

If "mandate_row"."details.description" contains the words: "(.*)at your request(.*)" assign "team" = "No action - at our request".

### Additional Fields to add:

- "crm"."account_number"
- "crm"."stage_name"
- "mandate_row".(concatenate("customers.given_name" + " " + "customers.family_name"))
- "crm"."C 0 Name"
- "crm"."premise_address"
- "crm"."C 0 Email"
- "crm"."C 0 ID"

### Processing Logic

if we have already an entry for that event "failed/cancelled" mandates from previous days, skip the record. If not...

Create file 1: "mandates-to-process-by-pre-installation-team-YYYY-MM-DD.csv", if "team" = "Pre Installation"

Create file 2: "mandates-to-process-by-post-installation-team-YYYY-MM-DD.csv", if "team" = "Post Installation"

## Usage

Just run...

```bash
./cm
```

This will use the default values:

```
Parameter:      Default value:
- db            = cancelled-mandates-database.sqlite3
- elevate       = elevate-accounts-YYYY-MM-DD.csv                                   with today's accounts from Elevate System
- crm           = crm-accounts-YYYY-MM-DD.csv                                       with today's/week's accounts from CRM System
- cancelled     = cancelled-mandates-YYYY-MM-DD.csv                                 with today's date: YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day)
- failed        = failed-mandates-YYYY-MM-DD.csv                                    with today's date: YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day)
- toPre         = mandates-to-process-by-pre-installation-team-YYYY-MM-DD.csv       with today's date: YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day)
- toPost        = mandates-to-process-by-post-installation-team-YYYY-MM-DD.csv      with today's date: YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day)
- toCheck       = mandates-to-check-YYYY-MM-DD.csv                                  with today's date: YYYY=year, MM=month, DD=day)
```

If you want to have more control, use the parameters and provide a value for a parameter such as the following example:

```bash
./cm -db cancelled-mandates-database.sqlite3 -from cancelled-mandates-2022-05-28.csv -toPre mandates-to-process-by-pre-installation-team-2022-05-28.csv -toPost mandates-to-process-by-post-installation-team-2022-05-28.csv -toCheck mandates-to-check-2022-05-28.csv
```

## What it does

![Process Flow](/documentation/cm-process.png)

The above program does the following:

- it reads accounts records from a `-accounts` file-name.csv, which you download from your Elevate system
- it reads crm accounts records from a `-crm` file-name.csv, which you download from your CRM system
- it reads cancelled mandates records from a `-from` file-name.csv, which you download from your payment provider
- if this parameter isn't provided, it opens the csv file: cancelled-mandates-YYYY-MM-DD.csv
- it writes those records to a local `-db` dbname.sqlite3 database, and...
  - if the cancelled-mandate event id is already in the database, it skips that record, as it is already in the database, or...
  - if the cancelled-mandate event id is not in the database, it inserts the record into the database.
- after inserting all provided new records...

### Pre Processing Team

- it checks the database for event ids 
- if found, create a record in the table preProcessing or postProcessing with
  - event_id as unique primary key
  - timestamp with today's date as secondary index
  - customers_id, customers_given_name, customers_family_name
- create a csv-file mandates-to-process-by-pre-installation-team-YYYY-MM-DD.csv containing all mandates to be processed
- enriching the the files with the account-numbers for the Elevate system for easier processing

### Post Processing Team

- it checks the database for payments_id, which had `-count-suspend` number or more of payment requests (default: 4)
- if found, create a record in the table paymentsSuspended
  - payments_id as unique primary key
  - timestamp with today's date secondary index
  - payment_requests_count
  - customers_id, customers_given_name, customers_family_name, customers_metadata_leadID
- if paymentsId already in the table paymentsSuspended, check if the the payment_requests_count has increased,
  - if it is increased, update the record with the new count and update the timestamp to today's date
  - if it is the same count, then skip the update.
- create a csv-file customers-to-suspend-YYYY-MM-DD.csv containing all customer payments which are to suspend by using today's timestamp
- the found payments_id with more than the allowed number of payment requests are exported in a new `-to` customers-to-suspend-YYYY-MM-DD.csv file
- if the customers-to-suspend-YYYY-MM-DD.csv file already exists, it will be overwritten with the new content
